# decisiontree

<h1>What is Decision Tree?</h1>
Decision Tree builds on the classification or regression models in the form of the tree structure. It utilizes an if-then rule which is mutually exclusive and exhaustive for classification. The rules are learned sequentially using the training data one at a time.
<h2>Example:</h2>
An example of a personal decision to use a decision tree for may be deciding whether or not you want to enter into a lawsuit with someone, and your chances of getting a judgment in your favor. Alternatively, you can map out what would happen if the lawsuit got extended, and what would happen in the case of a win or a loss for your side, including the legal fees or potential payoff for each decision.
<h2>Pros</h2>
1.Visual and systematic approach to breaking down decision making
2.Clearly outlines the long-term impacts of making certain decisions
3.Decision trees can also express trade-offs and probabilities
<h2>Cons</h2>
1.Over-complication of a decision can lead to analysis paralysis
2.Decision trees can be overly complex with too many pathways
3.Linked outcomes and uncertainty are hard to represent visually
